/*
For this project, you are going to create a simple event manager. 
You will need to have the following requirements implemented:
Classes for customers and orders which either use an interface or abstract class that they inherit some methods from.
A method in orders that when an order comes in for a customer, an event is triggered to notify something
 (it can just be output to the console and this would be similar to the example I created).
You should also create a method that will alert subscribers to when the order is ready to ship and 
need to create a class that subscribes to that event.
Inside of Main, you will create at least 10 customers and demonstrate the 
events trigger when an order is placed for one of the customers and when an order is ready to ship. 
Additionally write some queries using LINQ or lambdas to pull from the list of customers 
(name or other pieces of information for example).
