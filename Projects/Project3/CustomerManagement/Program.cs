/*

Create a program with the following requirements:

1) You must read in information from a file and create objects from the file. For instance, your file may look like this:
Bergen, Jeremy, 123456, Some Business, 123-456-7890
Skywalker, Luke, 542142, Rebel Alliance, 123-456-7890

where each field in the file corresponds to: last name, first name, customer id, business name, phone number

2) Read the file with at least 4 entries into some sort of collection (List, LinkedList, Dictionary, etc) and the collection should store the customers as objects.

3) create a class for customers with the variables(fields) that match what is in your input file with corresponding get and set for each one. Also you should have a constructor.

4) create an interface that your class inherits from with at least 2 methods you have to implement.

5) Your class should have a ToString and CompareTo (that you have to implement from IComparable or IComparer)

6) Demonstrate you mini customer database functioning and write out to a new file a formatted list for your customers, for example:
Last name: Bergen
First name: Jeremy
ID: 123456
Business: Some Business
Phone: 123-456-7890
